One of the most challenging things about being a self-taught developer is sifting through the plethora of amazing resources online to learn from.  With so many different technologies and paths to take it can be easy to find yourself overwhelmed.  The first step was deciding what path I wanted to take.  Once I did that, it became a lot easier to choose which resources were best for me to learn from.   

Throughout my learning process I have gathered a list of my favorite resources I like to learn from.  It is important to note, that these are resources that are good for me and work well with my learning style and the learning path I chose to take.  These same resources may not be the best for someone else.  For instance, someone who wants to be a Ruby developer may not find this list adequate for their learning path because I haven't studied Ruby so most of the resources don't contain any lessons on Ruby.

## Youtube

#### [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

Youtube has been a great resource for learning various topics.  It has helped me learn concepts in everything from HTML and CSS, to different libraries, frameworks, career advice, project ideas, and much more.  Youtube can often be an undervalued resource for those learning how to code, but if you are a visual learner, like me, then you can find a vast amount of videos to help you learn.  Some of my favorite channels to learn from are Brad Traversy, The New Boston, The Net Ninja, Dylan Israel, Joshua Fluke, Online Tutorials, and Academind.

## FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is another great resource that helped me on my learning journey.  Besides the content I was learning, it was a huge help in giving me a sense of direction.  By following the curriculum on 	FreeCodeCamp, I was able to decide what to learn next when I got stuck.  I used it as a sort of checklist.  Once I learned one part of the curriculum, it gave me a good idea as to what to learn next. .

## Udemy

Udemy has been a great resource for learning more advanced topics.  It is a paid option, but you can find great deals on the courses and usually get them for around $10-$12 and they are well worth your time and money.  The courses I have taken are JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steele, The Complete Node.js Developer Course by Andrew Mead, and React Front to Back and MERN Stack Front To Back by Brad Traversy.

## Scrimba

#### [visit resource](https://scrimba.com/)

Scrimba, a fairly new site/concept, has been an amazing resource.  This resource was my biggest asset when learning React.  They use the new concept of interactive screencasts  to teach lessons.  This is a great idea, and way to learn because it allows the learner to interact with the lesson the instructor is teaching and the code they are writing.  They are still working on building up content and lessons, but they already have a lot of great courses to start with.  You can learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, or React, Angular, or Vue to get you started.

## W3Schools

#### [visit resource](https://www.w3schools.com/)

Another resource I like to use is W3Schools.  I don't use this site so much for learning, as I do for reference.  When I need to look up syntax or different methods, this is usually my first go to.  They have information on HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, Bootstrap, Python, and many more.  You could learn from this site if you like by going through their tutorials, but as stated, I like to use it as more of a reference site.

## Javascript.info

#### [visit resource](https://javascript.info/)

Javascript.info is a resource I just recently came across and am working my way through.  Most of my resources are video/visual based but this is a written resource.  They go in depth about the Javascript language from beginning to end.  It is very well written and well explained to make it easier to understantd.  I would recommend, however, going through some other tutorials on Javascript first to get at least a little more familiar with the language and then using Javascript.info to go more indepth about the different concepts they cover.

These are just some of my main resources that have been there for me time and time again through my learning process.  I am always looking for more resources to draw from.  I feel that constantly looking for avenues to learn from is important and necessary if you are going to continue to grow your skills and get better.
